# scan well plate workflow 

## HARDWARE
1. plate model
2. objective
3. camera setting
4. stage calibration

## AIM
1. cell counting
- [x] mosaic 
- standard calibration plate
[] hardware error handle
[] software pause handle
[x] image circular buffer, nonblocked writing
6. remote mosaic calculation
7. send error to email

## Metainfo layout
1. pfs offset, pfs-on-off, x-y postion-free
2. z 
final data contain plate geometry and stage calibration?

We use json as data exchange format.

## Wish list
1. D-LED communication
2. relative coordinate of plate and flexible calibration
